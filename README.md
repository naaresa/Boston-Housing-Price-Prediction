 Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Boston using linear regression. It leverages the well-known Boston Housing dataset, a standard dataset for regression tasks in machine learning, to explore data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Since the project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, you'll also need Jupyter installed:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/boston-housing-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**  
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd boston-housing-price-prediction
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**  
   Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the Notebook**  
   In the Jupyter interface, open the file `Real Pricing Assignment (1).ipynb`.

5. **Run the Cells**  
   Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, explore it, train the linear regression model, and view the predictions. Visualizations will display inline thanks to `%matplotlib inline`.

## Data

The project uses the **Boston Housing dataset**, available directly through `scikit-learn`. It includes:

- **Number of Instances**: 506
- **Number of Features**: 13 (e.g., crime rate, average number of rooms, nitric oxide concentration)
- **Target Variable**: Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s)

For a detailed description, refer to the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/).

## Methodology

The workflow in the notebook consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Import the Boston Housing dataset from `scikit-learn`.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset with descriptive statistics, visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, distribution plots), and correlation analysis to understand feature relationships.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify key features (e.g., `RM`, `LSTAT`) based on correlation with the target variable (`MEDV`).
4. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using a subset of features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Generate predictions on a test set, compare them to actual values, and visualize the residuals.

The linear regression function is defined as:
```python
def lin_func(values, coefficients=lm.coef_, y_axis=lm.intercept_):
    return np.dot(values, coefficients) + y_axis
```

## Results

The trained model produces predictions that are compared to actual housing prices. Sample outputs show differences between predicted and real values (e.g., a prediction of 21.19 vs. a real value of 23.2). While the model performs reasonably well, additional metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared could be implemented for a more thorough evaluation.

Visualizations include:
- A scatter plot of predictions vs. actual values.
- A distribution plot of residuals.
